## Introduction

🔁 The For Loop application showcases the capabilities of the `for` loop in Python. The `for` loop is a fundamental control flow construct that iterates over a sequence of elements, such as lists, tuples, strings, or range objects and executes a block of code for each iteration.

This repository provides a collection of code examples that highlight different use cases and patterns of the `for` loop in Python programming. From simple iterations to complex data processing tasks, the For Loop application demonstrates the elegance and efficiency of the `for` loop.

## Features

✨ The For Loop application offers the following features:

- 🔁 **Iterating Over Sequences**: Examples demonstrating how to use the `for` loop to iterate over sequences like lists, tuples, strings, and range objects.
- 📝 **Loop Control**: Illustrations of loop control statements like `break` and `continue` to modify the flow of the loop execution.
- 🌟 **Nested Loops**: Examples showcasing the use of nested `for` loops for iterating over multiple dimensions or nested sequences.
- 📊 **Data Processing**: Code snippets demonstrating how the `for` loop can be used to process and analyze data, such as computing aggregates, filtering, or transforming data.
- 🧪 **Test Coverage**: The application includes comprehensive tests to ensure the correctness of the code examples and provide a foundation for experimentation and learning.
